                <h2>ABOUT TETRIS®</h2>
                <p>
                    Tetris® is the addictive puzzle game that started it all, embracing our universal desire to create order out of chaos. The Tetris game was created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984—the product of Alexey’s computer programming experience and his love of puzzles. In the decades to follow, Tetris became one of the most successful and recognizable video games, appearing on nearly every gaming platform available. This page is the official destination for free online single-player Tetris. Click PLAY to start playing one of the world’s most popular puzzle games now!

                <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
                <p>
                    The goal of Tetris is to score as many points as possible by clearing horizontal lines of Blocks. The player must rotate, move, and drop the falling Tetriminos inside the Matrix (playing field). Lines are cleared when they are filled with Blocks and have no empty spaces.
                    As lines are cleared, the level increases and Tetriminos fall faster, making the game progressively more challenging. If the Blocks land above the top of the playing field, the game is over.
